# Traffic Light Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying traffic lights (red, yellow, green) in real-world images using computer vision techniques. The primary goal is to identify traffic lights and classify their colors accurately, even under diverse lighting, angles, and environmental conditions. 

The solution is implemented in Python using OpenCV and includes preprocessing, HSV-based color segmentation, contour detection, and conflict resolution for overlapping colors.

## Features
- Detects traffic lights in static images.
- Classifies detected lights into red, yellow, and green.
- Handles diverse conditions such as glare, reflections, and distance.
- Displays the detected lights with bounding circles and color annotations.
- Outputs detailed information (center, radius, and color) for each detected traffic light.
